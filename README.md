WebCraft (HTML5 Minecraft)
---------------------
This is just a personal fork that I needed to get texture mapping to work on some school chromebooks.

I don't know Javascript, only java.  I just copied three lines of code from stack overflow and deleted two lines, much like others who say they can code.

I most likely broke some things, but I don't care.  I'll never get to fixing them.  The textures look blurry, if you know Javascript, feel free to fix this issue.

Just use https://github.com/Overv/WebCraft unless you were sent this link because you are trying to run games on a chromebook.
